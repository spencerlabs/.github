        Write your proposal here. You're welcome to structure it however you like, but the more detail, the better. Get into the specifics and include examples. Keep this non-exhaustive list of questions in mind as you write:

        - What's this about?
        - What's the design in detail?
        - Is this a breaking change? How easy will it be for current users to adopt?
        - What parts of the design are still TBD?
